This directory contains various examples of embedded Jetty code.

You can run the examples with:

  mvn -DrunEmbedded test

You will be prompted for the name of the example to run.

Note that some examples, such as the LikeJettyXml example can only be run from the top level directory, so use an IDE such as Eclipse to run that more conveniently.
