This is a Jetty Connector that uses the grizzly NIO layer from glassfish.
It is the start of an effort to integrate Jetty with Glassfish, but this
is a very early stage and nothing is working yet....

The compile this you need a maven2 repository with 
modules/grizzly/repository/com/sun/enterprise/appserv-http-engine/9.0-SNAPSHOT/appserv-http-engine-9.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Currently this code is a mix of apache and Suns CDDL licenses and the
copyright is variously held by Sun and Mort Bay consulting.  This license
mashup will be resolved as more of the code is written and a proper home
found for it.
